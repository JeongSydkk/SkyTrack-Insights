# SkyTrack-Insights
SkyTrack Insights is a data analytics project focused on the performance of domestic airlines in Australia.
Using official government datasets on on-time departures, arrivals, and cancellations, the project demonstrates how to build a full analytics pipeline:

Data preparation: cleaning and restructuring raw CSVs into a relational database.

Database design: creating an ER diagram with fact and dimension tables (airlines, airports, dates, routes).

SQL analytics: queries for delay rates, cancellation patterns, route performance, and airline comparisons.

Python integration: running queries programmatically and exporting results.

Visualization (future): dashboards in Apache Superset for interactive insights.

The goal is to simulate the role of a data analyst in an airline operations context and provide a foundation for data-driven decision making.
